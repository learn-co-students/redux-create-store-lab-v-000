/* write a function createStore that takes in a
reducer function as an argument. We've prvided the reducer functions
for you so you can get a sense of how they'll work.
The createStore function should return an object with 2 methods
getState, dispatch. 

getState should return the current state

dispatch should take in an action, update the state using the reducer,
and call the render function.

Note: don't forget your initial state for each store should be set by the
reducer. You'll have to dispatch some sort of initialize action to
get your state set.
